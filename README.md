# Introduction

The Translatekar Application is a web-based tool that allows users to translate text between different languages. It consists of a frontend, built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, and a backend API deployed at https://github.com/sajalmandrekar/deploy_tf_model. The backend API is responsible for handling translation requests and providing the translated text back to the frontend.

## Features
- Input text and select source/target languages from a user-friendly interface.
- Instantly translate text between languages using an integrated translation engine.

## Getting Started

To set up the Translator Application locally, follow these steps:

### Frontend
1. Clone the frontend repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/sayleephadte/translatekar-frontend.git
2. Navigate to the frontend project directory:
$ cd translatekar-frontend
3. Install the frontend dependencies:
$ npm install
4. Start the frontend development server:
$ npm start
5. The frontend should now be running on your local machine at http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port if you've customized it).

### Backend

The backend API for the Translator Application is available at https://github.com/sajalmandrekar/deploy_tf_model. Follow the instructions in that repository's README to set up the backend server.

Make sure the backend server is running and accessible at an appropriate URL, as the frontend will communicate with it for translations.
