Translatekar

Introduction
The Translatekar Application is a web-based tool that allows users to translate text between different languages. It consists of a frontend, built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, and a backend API deployed at https://github.com/sajalmandrekar/deploy_tf_model. The backend API is responsible for handling translation requests and providing the translated text back to the frontend.

Features
1. Input text and select source/target languages from a user-friendly interface.
2. Instantly translate text between languages using an integrated translation engine.

$ npm install
4. Start the frontend development server:
$ npm start
